	Containerization using Docker!
	
	
	DevOps Stages ::

		- Continuous Delivery/Deployment 		==> Prod Release

	Containerization : 
	
		=> Is a process of packaging the application along with its dependencies.
		
	Virtual Machines :
	
		- VMs are considered as Hardware Level Virtualization 
		- VMs are created using Hypervisor
		- VMs are used to Execute Operating System 
		- VMs continue to run even if there is no active application/task
		- VMs consume more space and time to start any application/task.
		
	Containers :
	
		- Containers are considered as OS-Level Virtualization 
		- Containers are created using Container Engine
		- Containers are used to Execute application/task, Not Operating System 
		- Containers will immediately go to Exit State if there is no active application/task
		- Containers consume less space and time to start any application/task.
		
			- Namespace and Control Groups are the core (Kernel) components of Operating System 
					- With this Containers run in a dedicated/Isolated address space.		
	
		- Container are used to reduce the no. of VMs 
		
		=> Containerization - Is a process of packaging the application along with its dependencies.

Working with DockerHub :	


Install docker Container Engine in Local Machine :

	-> Install Docker in existing Jenkin_Slave Node
	-> apt install docker.io -y				# https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
	
Working Docker CLI Commands :


	-> docker --version 
	
	-> docker images 			# List the docker images in the machine 
	
	-> docker ps 				# List the active/running Containers in the machine 

	-> docker ps -a 			# List of all the active/stopped Containers in the machine

	Docker CLI Commands :
	
		- Create Containers 
		- Work with Containers 

	-> docker --version 
	
	-> docker images 				# List the docker images in the machine 
	
	-> docker ps 					# List the active/running Containers in the machine 

	-> docker ps -a 				# List of all the active/stopped Containers in the machine 	
	
	-> docker pull <image_name>		# To download the Container Image from DockerHub
	
		Eg.: docker pull alpine
		
			 docker pull centos 
			 
			 docker pull ubuntu 
			 
			 docker pull tomcat
			 
	- docker run <image_name>		# Create and execute a Container based on a image name
	
	Three Modes of Container Execution :
	Container Execution Modes ::
	
		- Foreground / Attached Mode 		# Default Mode 
		
				docker run <image_name> 
				
				Eg.: 					
					docker run alpine sleep 30
		
		- Background / Detached Mode 
			
				docker run -d <image_name> 
				Eg.: 				
					docker run -d alpine sleep 30	
		
		- Interactive Mode 
		
				docker run -it <image_name> 
				Eg.: 
				
					docker run -it alpine sh 		

					docker run -it ubuntu sh 	

	- docker start <Container_ID>		# Start a container
	
		Eg.: 
		
			docker start ab85d99cbd20
			
	- docker exec -it <Container_ID> bash		# Login to a running container
	
		Eg.: 
			docker exec -it ab85d99cbd20 bash
			
			exit								# Logoff from Container
			
			
	- docker stop <Container_ID> 
	
		Eg.: 
			docker stop ab85d99cbd20


	- Port Mapping :

	Port Mapping / Port Binding ::::
	
		- It is used to expose the container to access thru internet 
		
		- It is a process of mapping the container port with the host port.
	
	Run Application inside the Container!
	
		docker run -it tomcat:8.0 bash
		
		docker run -it -p <host_Port>:<container_Port> tomcat:8.0
		
		Eg:
		
		docker run -it -p 8089:8080 tomcat:8.0
	
		-p <host_Port>:<container_Port>

			- Dockerfile composed of Instructions to Create Docker Container Images
			- Application Developers create the Dockerfile and update in the Source Code Repository. 


		vi Dockerfile 
		
		FROM ubuntu 
		RUN apt update -y 
		RUN apt install git -y 
		RUN apt install maven -y 
		
			Syntax :
			
			docker build -t <dockerhub_repo_name>/New_Image_Name>:<tag_Name> .		# '.' refers to the Dockerfile path
			
			Eg.:
			
			docker build -t loksaieta/sa-ai-javabuildimg .		# '.' refers to the Dockerfile path
			
		Write Dockerfile :::
		
			Docker File Instructions :::

	-> Container Volumes :::
	
		- Docker Volume 		# used to maintain the persistant data
		
	==> 3-Tier Application Architecture :
		
		- Front-End Layer	=> User Interface 
		
		- Application Layer	=> Business Logics  
		
		- Back-End Layer	=> Database 
	
	

	Sign-Up Service:	# Containerized Application Service 
	
	- Front-End Layer	=> User Interface 	: C1 
	
	- Application Layer	=> Business Logics  : C2 
	
	- Back-End Layer	=> Database 		: C3
	
	
	Docker Volume :
	
		docker volume list 
		
		docker volume create sa-ai-vol1
		
		docker volume inspect sa-ai-vol1
		
		docker run -it --mount source=sa-ai-vol1,destination=/sa-ai-vol1 ubuntu bash
		
	
	-> Container Orchestration :::
	
		-> Overview of Docker Compose 
		
		
		Docker Compose :::
			- Is used to run multiple containers as a Service.
			- It is an additional plugin to Docker.
		
		- Sign-Up Service :
		
			- Front-End Layer	=> User Interface 	: C1.0 
			
			- Application Layer	=> Business Logics  : C2.0 
			
			- Back-End Layer	=> Database 		: C3.0			
			
		Need run the containers as a service! 
		
		How to execute more than once container as a service ???
		
		Docker Compose
			- Is an extension/Plugin to Docker Engine.
			- Is used to run multiple containers as a Service!
			- Docker Compose uses the Yaml file to create the Service definitions
			
		User_SignIn_Service:
			C1.0 
            C2.0            
            C3.0
				
			
			Any Container that is part of a Service :
		
				should be in-sync with other container within the service 
				
				
				Start/Stop all these container at the same time.
		
		
		
		Work with Docker Compose ::
		
			Install Docker_Compose
			
			https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/
			
# Manual Installation of Docker Compose :::
			
DOCKER_CONFIG=${DOCKER_CONFIG:-$HOME/.docker}
mkdir -p $DOCKER_CONFIG/cli-plugins
curl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.24.0/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o $DOCKER_CONFIG/cli-plugins/docker-compose

chmod +x $DOCKER_CONFIG/cli-plugins/docker-compose
	
docker compose version

vi docker-compose.yaml



### Yaml Files are based on Keys & Values -- key:value Pairs

version: '3'
services:
  webserv1:
    image: "tomcat:8.0"
    ports:
      - 8098:8080
  dbserv1:
    image: "redis:alpine"
	
docker compose up 

docker compose down 

	
		
==> Overview of Docker Swarm :::


	Container Orchestration Tool ::::
	
	Docker Swarm ::::
	
		- Docker Swarm is one the Container Orchestration Tools.
		- It is meant only for Docker Containers.
		- Used to Ensure High Availability of Containers by creating Replicas of Containers.
		- We cannot Do Auto-Scaling or Load Balancing!

	Kubernetes ::::
	
		- It is a Open-Source Container Orchestration Tool 
		- Kubernetes is used to Deploy any type of Containers.
		- It is used to ensure high availability of the Applications/services running thru Containers.
		- Used to Ensure High Availability of Containers by creating Replicas of Containers.
		- It supports Auto-Scaling & Load Balancing.

	3-Tier Application Service :
	
		User_SignIn Service :
	
			Front-End		-->		C1.0,C1.1,C1.2,C1.3,C1.4 
			
			Application_Layer 	-->		C2.0,C2.1,C2.2,C2.3,C2.4
			
			Database Layer 		-->		C3.0,C3.1,C3.2,C3.3,C3.4


		5000 users ==> 100 replicas of containers

		50000 users ==> 1000 replicas of containers
