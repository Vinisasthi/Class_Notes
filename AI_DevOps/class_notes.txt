What is AI ?

Implement AI for DevOps :::

DevOps Stages :

	Continuous Development :
	
	- code generation
	
	- script generation 
	
	- Highlight the syntax error 
	
	- Autofill the syntax
	
	- Perform code optimization 
	
	- Code Quality Analysis
	
	- Coding Standards	
	
	AI Tools:
	
	- copilot 
	
	- gemini

	
	Testing :::
	
		AI based automated testing 
		
		Unit Testing 
		
			- Test Data 
			
			- Test Cases 
			
			- Reusability of Test Data and Scenarios
			
			- Capture the Test Coverage 
			
			- Code Coverage 	
		
		Test.ai 
		
		Produce the Test Reports 
		
		Logs 
		
		Generate the Test Report 
		
		Root Cause Analysis of the the Issues.
		
		Capturing the potential issues / Vul. -> hardcoded user name & password in the program
		
		Prepare a chatbot - Teams 
		
	Deployments :
	
	- Predictive Analysis :
	
	Continuous Monitoring :::
	
		- Generate monitoring Reports/Dashboards :
		- Generate Monitoring Logs
		
	Tools :
	
		- Dynatrace Davis
		- Amazon Code Guru
		- DataDog - AI & ML based Monitoring Solutions

	Kubernetes Deployments : Troubleshooting 
	
	Scenario 1: 
	
		Pods are up and running!
		
			Issue: Appln - is not getting the desired output!
			
			- port mapping
			
	Scenario 2: 
	
		Pods are up and running!
		
			Issue: Appln Service is unreachable!
			
			AI => Data Source!
			
			Generative AI :
			
			Prompt Engineering! ***
			
			AI Agents!
			
		Kubernetes :
		
			kubectl describe ?
			
				- Used to Diagonize the Issues
				- get the various events 
				
			AI Tool to Troubleshoot Kubernetes Objects.
		
			- K8sgpt
			
			Helm Charts :
			
				--> Is a package manager for Kubernetes Cluster.
				
				apt ==> used to install/Uninstall/Upgrade the linux package in a Ubuntu Machine.
				
				Kubernetes_Master
					KWN1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,.......,175---200
					
					-> Prometheus/Grafana ==> 
					
					- Use the Prometheus/Grafana Images and execute as pods in kubernetes cluster.			
			
					-> Kubernetes Dashboard to Monitoring the Pods and other Kubernetes Objects.
					
			1. Install Helm on Kubernetes_Master Node 
			
			2. Use Helm to install Prometheus/Grafana 
			
			3. Execute Prometheus/Grafana as Pods
